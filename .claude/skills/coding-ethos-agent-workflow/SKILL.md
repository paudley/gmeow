# Coding-Ethos Agent Workflow

Use this skill as the default operating map for coding-ethos-enabled repos. It tells agents which first-class surface to use instead of falling back to raw shell, raw Git, host linters, or whole-repo reads.

## ETHOS Grounding
- `one-path-for-critical-operations`: Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.
- `evidence-based-engineering-and-decision-quality`: Understand, plan, execute, and validate with evidence; measure before
optimizing and make trade-offs explicit.
- `radical-visibility`: Log important decisions with context and instrument the system with metrics.
- `security-by-design`: Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.

## Short Hint
Start with MCP orientation and preflight tools, then execute through cerun or managed_lint only when the policy path says it is appropriate.

## Use When
- MCP
- cerun
- agent hooks
- raw git
- run command
- repo orientation
- managed lint
- policy feedback
- code intel

## Remediation Workflow
1. For broad work, call skill_recommend and code_intel_repo_map before reading widely or editing.
2. For shell, Git, Python, or tool commands, call cerun_check first; run through cerun_run or the repo-local cerun wrapper only after preflight.
3. For lint, formatting, or type checks, call managed_lint before using any fallback wrapper.
4. For hook or lint failures, pass agent_remediation to remediation_explain or call policy_explain/skill_lookup from the embedded MCP next step.
5. Report the MCP calls, command boundary, and verification evidence so downstream maintainers can reproduce the workflow.

## Principle Details
### One Path for Critical Operations

When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path.

Directive: Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.

Quick ref:
- Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.
- When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path.
- Use the repo's canonical validation entrypoint; do not invent partial substitutes.

#### Overview
When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path. We enforce a single, canonical path
for operations that matter.

#### No Modal Behavior Switches
**We strictly ban boolean parameters that fundamentally change what a
function does.**

A parameter like `persist: bool = True` creates two different
functions
masquerading as one. Callers must understand not just *what* the
function
does, but *which version* they're invoking. This is a recipe for
confusion
and bugs.

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Boolean switch creates two code paths
async def onboard_dataframe(
    self,
    entity_id: str,
    dataframe: DataFrame,
    *,
    persist: bool = True,  # This creates a fork in behavior
) -> ProcessingResult:
    result = self._compute_schema_and_stats(dataframe)

    if persist:  # One code path: compute AND store
        await self._store_metadata(entity_id, result)
        await self._store_statistics(entity_id, result)

    return result  # Other code path: compute only
```

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

1. **Hidden Complexity:** The function signature lies about what it
   does.
   Two behaviors, one name.
2. **Testing Burden:** Both paths must be tested, but only one is
   typically
   exercised in production.
3. **Bug Magnet:** Callers pick the wrong path. The bug we hit:
   `persist=True` bypassed ULID generation because it wasn't the
   canonical
   persistence path.
4. **Violation of SRP:** The function has two reasons to
   change—computation
   logic OR persistence logic.
5. **Documentation Rot:** Docstrings must explain both modes,
   inevitably
   becoming stale for one.

#### The Correct Way: Separate Concerns, Single Path
If an operation can be decomposed, decompose it. If persistence must
happen,
it happens through ONE designated service.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Function does ONE thing
async def onboard_dataframe(
    self,
    entity_id: str,
    dataframe: DataFrame,
) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Compute schema and statistics for a dataframe.

    This function ONLY computes. It does NOT persist.
    Persistence is handled by EntityMetadataService.ingest_dataset().
    """
    return ProcessingResult(
        schema=self._infer_schema(dataframe),
        profile=self._compute_statistics(dataframe),
    )

# ✅ CORRECT: Orchestration layer calls the ONE persistence path
async def ingest(self, request: IngestionRequest) -> IngestionResponse:
    onboarding_result = await onboarding_service.onboard_dataframe(...)

    # THE canonical path for persistence—generates ULID, stores everything
    await dataset_service.ingest_dataset(entity_id, metadata_payload)
```

#### Identifying Modal Functions
Watch for these warning signs:

* Parameters named `persist`, `save`, `commit`, `execute`, `dry_run`,
  `skip_*`
* Boolean parameters that guard large `if/else` blocks
* Functions where "it depends" on a flag whether side effects occur
* Docstrings that say "If X is True, then... otherwise..."

#### Canonical Validation Entry Points
Repos must define one documented way to run quality gates locally.

If a repo documents `make check`, `pre-commit run --all-files`, or
another
validation entrypoint, use that path.

Do not substitute a hand-picked subset and then claim the work is
validated.

Alternate commands may exist for debugging, but only the canonical
gate
proves readiness.

#### The Exception: Explicit Dry-Run at API Boundaries
A `dry_run` parameter is acceptable ONLY at the outermost API boundary
(CLI
commands, REST endpoints) where the user explicitly requests a
preview. It
must:

1. Be clearly named and documented as a preview mode
2. Execute the SAME code path but skip the final commit/write
3. Never be the mechanism for internal code to "optionally" persist

```python
# ✅ ACCEPTABLE: CLI dry-run for user preview
@cli.command()
def ingest(path: Path, dry_run: bool = False):
    """Ingest a dataset. Use --dry-run to preview without persisting."""
    result = service.ingest(path, dry_run=dry_run)
    # dry_run affects the FINAL write, not internal behavior
```

#### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)
* ❌ `def process(data, save: bool = True)` — modal persistence
* ❌ `def validate(schema, strict: bool = False)` — if strictness
  matters,
  make two functions
* ❌ `def fetch(url, cache: bool = True)` — caching is infrastructure,
  not a
  per-call decision
* ❌ Internal functions with `persist`, `commit`, or `store` boolean
  parameters

#### The Rule
For any critical operation, ask: "Is there exactly ONE way to do this
correctly?" If the answer involves "it depends on a boolean
parameter," the design is wrong. Split the function, or designate a
single orchestration point.
### Evidence-Based Engineering and Decision Quality

Good engineering decisions are grounded in evidence, explicit
trade-offs, and calibrated risk.

Directive: Understand, plan, execute, and validate with evidence; measure before
optimizing and make trade-offs explicit.

Quick ref:
- Evidence > assumptions; runnable behavior and measurements outrank speculation.
- Understand -> plan -> execute -> validate, using batching and context
awareness when they reduce waste.
- Evaluate decisions across quality, reversibility, risk, and human impact.

#### Overview
We do not treat engineering judgment as intuition dressed up as
confidence.
Good decisions are grounded in evidence, explicit trade-offs, and
calibrated
risk.

**Core directive:** Evidence > assumptions. Runnable behavior, tests,
metrics, and credible primary sources outrank speculation and
unsupported
prose. Documentation remains a contract, but prose cannot excuse
behavior
the system does not actually implement.

**Communication directive:** Efficiency > verbosity. Be concise when
possible, but not at the cost of correctness, evidence, or important
nuance.

#### Task-First Operating Model
The default execution loop is:

1. **Understand:** Gather the local facts first. Read the code, issue,
   config, logs, or docs that define the problem.
2. **Plan:** Identify the critical path, dependencies, and likely
   failure
   modes before editing.
3. **Execute:** Make the smallest change set that actually resolves
   the
   problem.
4. **Validate:** Confirm behavior with tests, static analysis,
   metrics, or
   direct inspection.

Efficiency matters, so independent reads and checks should be batched
where
possible. Context also matters: preserve enough local understanding to
avoid
redundant work or contradictory edits across sessions and operations.

#### Systems Thinking and Trade-Offs
Every change has ripple effects. Evaluate the immediate local win
against
architecture-wide consequences, long-term maintenance cost, and the
options
you may close off by acting too narrowly.

When making a decision, ask:

* What other components, operators, or workflows does this change
  constrain?
* Is this change easy to reverse, costly to reverse, or effectively
  irreversible?
* Are we preserving future options under uncertainty, or spending them
  carelessly?
* Are we accepting risk intentionally, or just failing to model it?

Prefer designs that keep future choices open unless the stronger
constraint
is itself a deliberate requirement.

#### Data-Driven Choices
Optimization without measurement is guesswork. Performance claims,
reliability claims, and architecture claims should be backed by
evidence
that can be inspected or reproduced.

The expected pattern is:

* **Measure first:** Establish current behavior before claiming
  improvement.
* **Form hypotheses explicitly:** State what you think will change and
  why.
* **Validate sources:** Prefer primary documentation, tests, traces,
  and
  metrics over retellings.
* **Recognize bias:** Be wary of recency bias, sunk-cost bias, and
  confirmation bias when interpreting results.

If the evidence is weak, say so directly and reduce the claim strength
accordingly.

#### Proactive Risk Management
Risk management is not fear-driven paralysis; it is disciplined
foresight.
Anticipate the likely failure modes before they become production
incidents,
security regressions, or migration traps.

For meaningful changes:

* Identify the major risks up front.
* Assess both probability and impact.
* Decide whether the risk is acceptable, needs mitigation, or blocks
  the
  change.
* Put the mitigation in the plan, not in the postmortem.

Security risk, data-loss risk, migration risk, and operator-confusion
risk
should be considered explicitly, not absorbed into a vague notion of
"complexity."

#### Quality Lens
Evaluate changes through four quality lenses:

* **Functional quality:** correctness, reliability, completeness
* **Structural quality:** maintainability, clarity, technical debt
* **Performance quality:** latency, throughput, resource efficiency
* **Security quality:** access control, validation, data protection

Prefer preventive measures and automated enforcement whenever
practical;
they catch issues earlier and more consistently than manual heroics.
When a
design decision affects end users or operators, human welfare and
autonomy
matter: do not trade away safety, clarity, or informed control for
superficial convenience.
### Radical Visibility

We believe that if an event wasn't logged, it didn't happen.

Directive: Log important decisions with context and instrument the system with metrics.

Quick ref:
- Log important decisions with context and instrument the system with metrics.
- We believe that if an event wasn't logged, it didn't happen.
- Everything is Logged: Ingestion steps, query rewrites, cache
hits/misses, and decision branches must emit logs.

#### Overview
We believe that if an event wasn't logged, it didn't happen. Logging
is not a debugging tool to be added later; it is a primary feature of
the system.

#### Ubiquitous Logging
* **Everything is Logged:** Ingestion steps, query rewrites, cache
  hits/misses, and decision branches must emit logs.
* **Structured Data:** We use structlog to treat logs as data, not
  text.
  Logs must be machine-parsable (JSON in production).
* **Context is King:** Every log line must carry context. Who
  initiated
  this? What is the correlation_id? What dataset is being processed?
  * *Anti-Pattern:* logger.error("File not found")
  * *Required:* logger.error("ingestion_failed",
    reason="file_not_found",
    path=path, entity_id=id, correlation_id=cid)

#### Traceability
Because we rely on dependency injection and protocols, control flow
can be complex. Detailed logging allows us to reconstruct the
execution path of any request post-mortem.

#### Metrics Instrumentation
Logs tell us *what happened*. Metrics tell us *how often* and *how
fast*.
Both are mandatory.

* **OTel is Standard:** We use OpenTelemetry for all metrics. No
  custom
  metrics frameworks.
* **Every Operation is Measured:** Counters for occurrences,
  histograms for
  durations, gauges for current state.
* **Labels Add Dimension:** Metrics without labels are nearly useless.
  Include `status`, `operation`, `component`.

**The Correct Way:**

```python
from app.observability.tracing import (
    increment_counter,
    record_histogram,
    traced,
)

@traced("ingestion.process_file", {"component": "ingestion"})
async def process_file(self, path: Path) -> ProcessResult:
    start = time.perf_counter()
    try:
        result = await self._do_process(path)
        increment_counter("app.files_processed_total", {"status": "success"})
        return result
    finally:
        duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
        record_histogram("app.process_duration_ms", duration_ms)
```

If you cannot answer "How many times did X happen last hour?" or "What
is
the p99 latency of Y?"—your code is incomplete.
### Security by Design

Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the design.

Directive: Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.

Quick ref:
- Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.
- Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the design.
- Secrets, credentials, and API keys must never appear in source code,
configuration files, or commit history.

#### Overview
Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the
design. We build security in from the start.

#### No Secrets in Code
Secrets, credentials, and API keys must never appear in source code,
configuration files, or commit history.

* **Environment variables:** All secrets loaded via environment
  (`.env`
  files)
* **Never commit secrets:** No API keys, passwords, or tokens in any
  file
* **No default secrets:** Never provide "example" credentials that
  could be
  used in production

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded secrets
API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."  # NEVER
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:password123@prod-db/..."  # NEVER

# ❌ WRONG: "Example" secrets that become real
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY", "sk-test-key-for-development")  # Still wrong
```

**The Correct Way:**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Secrets from environment, no defaults
API_KEY = os.environ["API_KEY"]  # Fails if not set - good

# ✅ CORRECT: Explicit configuration validation
@dataclass
class Config:
    api_key: str = field(default_factory=lambda: os.environ["API_KEY"])

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if not self.api_key:
            raise ConfigurationError(
                "API_KEY environment variable is required"
            )
```

#### Parameterized Queries Only
SQL injection is a solved problem. We solve it by using parameterized
queries exclusively.

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ CATASTROPHIC: String formatting SQL
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # SQL injection
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name  # SQL injection
```

**The Correct Way:**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Parameterized queries
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
result = await conn.fetch(query, user_id)

# ✅ CORRECT: Using query builder with parameterization
query = select(users).where(users.c.id == bindparam("user_id"))
result = await conn.execute(query, {"user_id": user_id})
```

#### Input Validation at Boundaries
All external input is untrusted. Validate at the boundary, then trust
internally.

* **API endpoints:** Validate all request parameters with Pydantic
* **File inputs:** Validate file types, sizes, and content
* **Configuration:** Validate at startup, not at use time (see
  [Validation at the Gate](#validation-at-the-gate))

#### Production Database Detection
Operations that could harm production must detect and refuse
production
environments.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Production safety guard
async def reset_database(conn: Connection) -> None:
    """Reset database to clean state. NEVER runs in production."""
    db_name = await conn.fetchval("SELECT current_database()")
    if "prod" in db_name.lower():  # Add your production DB name check here
        raise SecurityError(
            f"Refusing to reset production database: {db_name}",
            database=db_name,
    )
    await conn.execute("TRUNCATE application_owned_table RESTART IDENTITY")
```

#### Automated Security Gates
Repos should automatically detect obvious security regressions before
commit
and in CI.

Secret scanning, unsafe query detection, boundary validation, and
environment-safety guards should be machine-enforced where the repo
can
express them.

If a repo ships security hooks, they are part of the build contract
and must
not be bypassed casually.

#### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)
* ❌ Secrets in source code, config files, or environment defaults
* ❌ String-formatted SQL queries
* ❌ Trusting user input without validation
* ❌ Running destructive operations without environment checks
* ❌ Assuming security features exist without verifying them

**The Rule:** Security is not optional. It is validated, enforced, and
designed into every component. If a security measure can be bypassed,
it's
not a security measure—it's a suggestion.

## Output Discipline
When explaining a fix, name the ETHOS principle, the concrete code change, and the verification evidence. Do not recommend weakening lint config or adding suppressions unless the ETHOS policy explicitly allows it.
