# Managed Toolchain And Config Integrity

Use this skill when lint behavior differs between repos, a generated config drift check fails, or a tool invocation is using consumer or host settings instead of the managed coding-ethos toolchain.

## ETHOS Grounding
- `static-analysis-is-the-first-line-of-defense`: Make ruff and mypy blocking quality gates rather than advisory tools.
- `validation-at-the-gate`: Validate configuration, schema, and extensions during bootstrap rather
than on first use.
- `one-path-for-critical-operations`: Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.
- `security-by-design`: Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.

## Short Hint
Linters and configs must resolve through coding-ethos managed paths. Restore generated configs and run captured tools through the wrapper.

## Use When
- managed toolchain
- tool_capabilities
- config drift
- generated config
- real binary not found
- host linter
- package-relative path
- tool capture
- fix-configs

## Remediation Workflow
1. Treat the consumer repo as untrusted for linter binaries and config.
2. Use MCP tool_capabilities to inspect managed sandbox posture before diagnosing missing tools, network access, or write-path failures.
3. Keep target file resolution faithful to the caller, but run the managed linter and managed config from the coding-ethos checkout.
4. If generated configs drift, restore them with the documented coding-ethos fix-configs path instead of editing hashes or ignores.
5. When a managed binary is missing, repair through make build rather than installing host-global tools or editing shims.
6. Capture the normalized lint output and trace so repeated failures can become stronger ETHOS mappings.

## Principle Details
### Static Analysis is the First Line of Defense

We rely on linters (ruff) and type checkers (mypy) to catch errors
before the code ever runs.

Directive: Make ruff and mypy blocking quality gates rather than advisory tools.

Quick ref:
- Use `make release-audit` for the full local gate.
- Use `make -C coding-ethos parent-lint` for coding-ethos policy lint.
- Keep parent lint scoped to production code; tests are verified by pytest.

#### Overview
We rely on linters (ruff) and type checkers (mypy) to catch errors
before
the code ever runs.

* We do not suppress linter errors unless absolutely necessary.
* Type hints are mandatory, not optional.
* If the CI pipeline fails static analysis, the code is effectively
  broken.

#### Machine-Enforced Gates
Static analysis belongs in enforced local hooks and CI, not in
optional
tribal knowledge.

* Repos should run their canonical lint and type suites automatically
  before
  code lands.
* If a repo exposes pre-commit, pre-push, or CI static analysis gates,
  treat
  them as part of the engineering contract.
* Passing the current local gate matters more than saying a previous
  run was
  green.

#### Repo Addendum
Gmeow uses project-local Makefile targets as the stable command surface for agents and CI. Prefer those targets so uv, pytest, build, and release hygiene checks remain consistent.
### Validation at the Gate

Configuration, schema, and extension availability are validated
immediately upon container initialization.

Directive: Validate configuration, schema, and extensions during bootstrap rather
than on first use.

Quick ref:
- Validate configuration, schema, and extensions during bootstrap rather
than on first use.
- Configuration, schema, and extension availability are validated
immediately upon container initialization.

#### Overview
Configuration, schema, and extension availability are validated
immediately
upon container initialization.

* If a Postgres extension is missing, we raise ExtensionMissingError
  immediately. We do not wait for a query to fail 5 hours later.
* If a cache adapter is misconfigured, we prevent the application from
  starting.
### One Path for Critical Operations

When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path.

Directive: Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.

Quick ref:
- Keep one explicit, validated path for critical operations.
- When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path.
- Use the repo's canonical validation entrypoint; do not invent partial substitutes.

#### Overview
When there are multiple ways to accomplish a critical operation, bugs
hide in the less-traveled path. We enforce a single, canonical path
for operations that matter.

#### No Modal Behavior Switches
**We strictly ban boolean parameters that fundamentally change what a
function does.**

A parameter like `persist: bool = True` creates two different
functions
masquerading as one. Callers must understand not just *what* the
function
does, but *which version* they're invoking. This is a recipe for
confusion
and bugs.

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Boolean switch creates two code paths
async def onboard_dataframe(
    self,
    entity_id: str,
    dataframe: DataFrame,
    *,
    persist: bool = True,  # This creates a fork in behavior
) -> ProcessingResult:
    result = self._compute_schema_and_stats(dataframe)

    if persist:  # One code path: compute AND store
        await self._store_metadata(entity_id, result)
        await self._store_statistics(entity_id, result)

    return result  # Other code path: compute only
```

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

1. **Hidden Complexity:** The function signature lies about what it
   does.
   Two behaviors, one name.
2. **Testing Burden:** Both paths must be tested, but only one is
   typically
   exercised in production.
3. **Bug Magnet:** Callers pick the wrong path. The bug we hit:
   `persist=True` bypassed ULID generation because it wasn't the
   canonical
   persistence path.
4. **Violation of SRP:** The function has two reasons to
   change—computation
   logic OR persistence logic.
5. **Documentation Rot:** Docstrings must explain both modes,
   inevitably
   becoming stale for one.

#### The Correct Way: Separate Concerns, Single Path
If an operation can be decomposed, decompose it. If persistence must
happen,
it happens through ONE designated service.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Function does ONE thing
async def onboard_dataframe(
    self,
    entity_id: str,
    dataframe: DataFrame,
) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Compute schema and statistics for a dataframe.

    This function ONLY computes. It does NOT persist.
    Persistence is handled by EntityMetadataService.ingest_dataset().
    """
    return ProcessingResult(
        schema=self._infer_schema(dataframe),
        profile=self._compute_statistics(dataframe),
    )

# ✅ CORRECT: Orchestration layer calls the ONE persistence path
async def ingest(self, request: IngestionRequest) -> IngestionResponse:
    onboarding_result = await onboarding_service.onboard_dataframe(...)

    # THE canonical path for persistence—generates ULID, stores everything
    await dataset_service.ingest_dataset(entity_id, metadata_payload)
```

#### Identifying Modal Functions
Watch for these warning signs:

* Parameters named `persist`, `save`, `commit`, `execute`, `dry_run`,
  `skip_*`
* Boolean parameters that guard large `if/else` blocks
* Functions where "it depends" on a flag whether side effects occur
* Docstrings that say "If X is True, then... otherwise..."

#### Canonical Validation Entry Points
Repos must define one documented way to run quality gates locally.

If a repo documents `make check`, `pre-commit run --all-files`, or
another
validation entrypoint, use that path.

Do not substitute a hand-picked subset and then claim the work is
validated.

Alternate commands may exist for debugging, but only the canonical
gate
proves readiness.

#### The Exception: Explicit Dry-Run at API Boundaries
A `dry_run` parameter is acceptable ONLY at the outermost API boundary
(CLI
commands, REST endpoints) where the user explicitly requests a
preview. It
must:

1. Be clearly named and documented as a preview mode
2. Execute the SAME code path but skip the final commit/write
3. Never be the mechanism for internal code to "optionally" persist

```python
# ✅ ACCEPTABLE: CLI dry-run for user preview
@cli.command()
def ingest(path: Path, dry_run: bool = False):
    """Ingest a dataset. Use --dry-run to preview without persisting."""
    result = service.ingest(path, dry_run=dry_run)
    # dry_run affects the FINAL write, not internal behavior
```

#### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)
* ❌ `def process(data, save: bool = True)` — modal persistence
* ❌ `def validate(schema, strict: bool = False)` — if strictness
  matters,
  make two functions
* ❌ `def fetch(url, cache: bool = True)` — caching is infrastructure,
  not a
  per-call decision
* ❌ Internal functions with `persist`, `commit`, or `store` boolean
  parameters

#### The Rule
For any critical operation, ask: "Is there exactly ONE way to do this
correctly?" If the answer involves "it depends on a boolean
parameter," the design is wrong. Split the function, or designate a
single orchestration point.
### Security by Design

Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the design.

Directive: Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.

Quick ref:
- Design for least privilege, validation, and safe defaults from the start.
- Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the design.
- Secrets, credentials, and API keys must never appear in source code,
configuration files, or commit history.

#### Overview
Security is not a feature to be added later—it is a property of the
design. We build security in from the start.

#### No Secrets in Code
Secrets, credentials, and API keys must never appear in source code,
configuration files, or commit history.

* **Environment variables:** All secrets loaded via environment
  (`.env`
  files)
* **Never commit secrets:** No API keys, passwords, or tokens in any
  file
* **No default secrets:** Never provide "example" credentials that
  could be
  used in production

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded secrets
API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."  # NEVER
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:password123@prod-db/..."  # NEVER

# ❌ WRONG: "Example" secrets that become real
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY", "sk-test-key-for-development")  # Still wrong
```

**The Correct Way:**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Secrets from environment, no defaults
API_KEY = os.environ["API_KEY"]  # Fails if not set - good

# ✅ CORRECT: Explicit configuration validation
@dataclass
class Config:
    api_key: str = field(default_factory=lambda: os.environ["API_KEY"])

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if not self.api_key:
            raise ConfigurationError(
                "API_KEY environment variable is required"
            )
```

#### Parameterized Queries Only
SQL injection is a solved problem. We solve it by using parameterized
queries exclusively.

**The Anti-Pattern (Forbidden):**

```python
# ❌ CATASTROPHIC: String formatting SQL
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # SQL injection
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name  # SQL injection
```

**The Correct Way:**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Parameterized queries
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
result = await conn.fetch(query, user_id)

# ✅ CORRECT: Using query builder with parameterization
query = select(users).where(users.c.id == bindparam("user_id"))
result = await conn.execute(query, {"user_id": user_id})
```

#### Input Validation at Boundaries
All external input is untrusted. Validate at the boundary, then trust
internally.

* **API endpoints:** Validate all request parameters with Pydantic
* **File inputs:** Validate file types, sizes, and content
* **Configuration:** Validate at startup, not at use time (see
  [Validation at the Gate](#validation-at-the-gate))

#### Production Database Detection
Operations that could harm production must detect and refuse
production
environments.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Production safety guard
async def reset_database(conn: Connection) -> None:
    """Reset database to clean state. NEVER runs in production."""
    db_name = await conn.fetchval("SELECT current_database()")
    if "prod" in db_name.lower():  # Add your production DB name check here
        raise SecurityError(
            f"Refusing to reset production database: {db_name}",
            database=db_name,
    )
    await conn.execute("DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE")
```

#### Automated Security Gates
Repos should automatically detect obvious security regressions before
commit
and in CI.

Secret scanning, unsafe query detection, boundary validation, and
environment-safety guards should be machine-enforced where the repo
can
express them.

If a repo ships security hooks, they are part of the build contract
and must
not be bypassed casually.

#### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)
* ❌ Secrets in source code, config files, or environment defaults
* ❌ String-formatted SQL queries
* ❌ Trusting user input without validation
* ❌ Running destructive operations without environment checks
* ❌ Assuming security features exist without verifying them

**The Rule:** Security is not optional. It is validated, enforced, and
designed into every component. If a security measure can be bypassed,
it's
not a security measure—it's a suggestion.

## Output Discipline
When explaining a fix, name the ETHOS principle, the concrete code change, and the verification evidence. Do not recommend weakening lint config or adding suppressions unless the ETHOS policy explicitly allows it.
